# SciBenchmark

SciBencmark is the implementation of different common computational science methods in different languages.
The main focus is different accelerations of python code, since python have become a very popular language.

Documentation can be found at:

http://scibenchmark.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

The program is run by:

```
python compile_all.py
```

```
python run_all.py
```

The benchmark is then written to Benchmark.csv
