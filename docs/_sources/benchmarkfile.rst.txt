
Benchmark rules
===============

For the benchmark all of the languages have to use the same algorithm. This means that there need to be a very easy one-to-one corrospondance between what the scripts do.

Numpy is the use of regular Python with numpy arrays. Numpy is also used in the other versions of Python code.

For the compiled languages all compiling flags are allowed.

For codes interfacing with Python, the IO have to be performed in a Python script. When Cython is used .pyx is counted as Python scripts.
